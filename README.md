## Inspiration & Reference
- [Caption] : Inspired by the captions next to artworks, I created a personal blog to showcase my life through captions.

- [The Life of Pablo] : "Inspired by Kanye West's 7th album, The Life of Pablo, I used the album art as a reference. The background color of the captions was set to coral, which is the main color of the album art, and I borrowed the album's title to create 'THE LIFE OF EELKOM'.  * "'eelkom' is a reverse version of the 'mok' and 'Lee' parts from my name, Changmok Lee."
  
- [Coverflow] : I brought back and applied iTunes' Cover Flow function, which was used in iPods and early versions of iOS but disappeared in 2012. I wanted to scroll and display my captions as album art using the Cover Flow function

- [Launchpad] : I created a small launchpad that can play the piano notes of 'Runaway.' Inspired by seeing Kanye West perform and use a launchpad to play his song 'Runaway,' I decided to build a compact launchpad specifically for playing the piano notes of the track.
